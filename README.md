# Numerical methods challenge

During October (2017) I wrote a program per day for some well-known numerical
methods in both Python and Julia. It was intended to be an exercise, then don't
expect the code to be good enough for real use. Also, I should mention that I
had almost no experience with Julia, so it probably is not idiomatic Julia but
more Python-like Julia.

There is a [blog post](https://nicoguaro.github.io/posts/numerical_summary/)
describing the content of this repository.

## Disclaimer

In this repository  I present the implementations for several numerical methods.
But they are not good-enough for practice or teaching. The codes are just
the result of a month-long challenge.
